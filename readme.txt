CT Commerce Lite is a Block based lightweight, modular eCommerce plugin designed to make your WordPress site fast, flexible, and feature-rich. 

== Description ==

**CT Commerce Lite** is more than just another WordPress eCommerce plugin—it's a Gutenberg Block based tool designed to help you build and grow your online store without sacrificing speed or simplicity. Whether you're running a small business, selling handmade goods, or managing a blog with an integrated shop, CT Commerce Lite has the flexibility to meet your needs.

### 🌟 **Key Features**:

- **🚀 Lightweight and Fast**: Weighing in at less than 200KB, CT Commerce Lite ensures your site remains lightning-fast. The frontend loads just 40KB of JavaScript, making it one of the leanest eCommerce plugins available. This speed boost is crucial, especially since studies show that a 100-millisecond delay in load time can reduce conversion rates by 7% ([source](https://www.akamai.com/)).

- **🔧 Gutenberg Block Integration**: Customize your store with ease using WordPress’s Gutenberg block editor. The plugin includes a built-in gallery block, complete with Image Gallery and Lightbox features, creating a visually stunning product display that engages customers.

- **💸 Dynamic Pricing and Variation Images**: Offer different prices and images based on product variations. Whether it's size, color, or style, you can set unique pricing and visuals for each option, giving your customers a tailored shopping experience.

- **🔗 Modular Design**: CT Commerce Lite is built with a modular approach, ensuring that your site only loads the features you need. This keeps server processing to a minimum and performance at its peak. Install additional functionality as needed through our growing library of add-ons—no unnecessary bloatware here!

- **🎨 Flexible Product Management**: Easily manage pricing, stock status, pre-orders, and more. Your products can be labeled as “out of stock” or “pre-order,” helping you manage inventory and set clear customer expectations.

- **💻 Theme Compatibility**: Whether you're using a custom theme or a popular template, CT Commerce Lite integrates seamlessly with minimal or no CSS adjustments required.

- **📊 Custom Dashboard**: Manage all your store's settings, view orders, and streamline administration from a centralized, intuitive dashboard.

- **📧 Built-in Features**:
  - **Gallery Block**: Integrated Image Gallery and Lightbox features, with the option to add other gallery, social sharing, and rating blocks to enhance the look and feel of your pages.
  - **SMTP Settings**: Send order information directly to your and customer email with built-in SMTP configuration.
  - **Shipping and Billing Settings**: Built-in tabs for managing shipping and billing, expandable via add-ons to suit your business needs.
